## Examples

### Basic Detection

```bash
$ cluely-detector
🎯 Cluely Detection
=================

✅ NO CLUELY DETECTED
No employee monitoring software found.
```

### When Cluely is Detected

```bash
$ cluely-detector
🎯 Cluely Detection
=================

🚨 CLUELY DETECTED
Employee monitoring software is running on this system.

💡 Use 'cluely-detector report' for detailed analysis
```

### Detailed Report

```bash
$ cluely-detector report
🚨 CLUELY EMPLOYEE MONITORING DETECTED
=====================================

📊 Summary:
   • Total Cluely windows: 2
   • Screen capture evasion: 2
   • Elevated layer usage: 1
   • Highest layer detected: 3

🔍 Evasion Techniques Detected:
   ⚠️  2 window(s) configured to avoid screen capture
   ⚠️  1 window(s) using elevated display layers

📋 Window Details:
   1. Window ID: 12345 [Cluely]
      - Sharing State: 0 (avoiding screen capture)
      - Layer: 0 (normal)
      - Techniques: Screen capture evasion

   2. Window ID: 12346 [Cluely]
      - Sharing State: 0 (avoiding screen capture)
      - Layer: 3 (elevated - potential overlay)
      - Techniques: Screen capture evasion, Elevated layer positioning

⚠️  WARNING:
   This software is designed to monitor employee activity
   while remaining hidden during screen sharing sessions.
   Your activities may be recorded even when sharing your screen.

### Continuous Monitoring

```bash
$ cluely-detector monitor
🔍 Monitoring for Cluely (Press Ctrl+C to stop)
=============================================

[2024-06-28 17:30:00 UTC] Status: NOT DETECTED
[2024-06-28 17:30:45 UTC] 🚨 CLUELY DETECTED - Monitoring software started!
[2024-06-28 17:31:00 UTC] Status: DETECTED
[2024-06-28 17:32:15 UTC] ✅ Cluely monitoring stopped
^C
👋 Monitoring stopped
```

## Exit Codes

- `0`: No Cluely detected (success)
- `1`: Cluely detected or error occurred

## Integration with Scripts

### Shell Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
if cluely-detector check; then
    echo "System is clean"
else
    echo "⚠️ Monitoring detected!"
    # Send alert, log, etc.
fi
```

### With jq for JSON Processing

```bash
# Get severity level
SEVERITY=$(cluely-detector json | jq -r '.severity')
echo "Detection severity: $SEVERITY"

# Check if screen capture evasion is being used
EVASION=$(cluely-detector json | jq -r '.screen_capture_evasion_count')
if [ "$EVASION" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "⚠️ Screen capture evasion detected!"
fi
```

### Automation Example

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Daily monitoring script

LOG_FILE="/var/log/cluely-detection.log"
RESULT=$(cluely-detector json)
TIMESTAMP=$(date)

echo "[$TIMESTAMP] $RESULT" >> "$LOG_FILE"

# Send alert if detected
if echo "$RESULT" | jq -e '.detected' > /dev/null; then
    # Send notification (email, Slack, etc.)
    echo "Cluely monitoring detected at $TIMESTAMP" | mail -s "Security Alert" admin@company.com
fi
```

## Requirements

- macOS 10.15+ (Catalina or later)
- May require accessibility permissions for full detection
